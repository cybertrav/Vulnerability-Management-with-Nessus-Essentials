<h1>Nessus Essentials Home Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab we will cover vulnerability scanning and vulnerability remediation. These are two of the main steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle. We will be using Nessus Essentials to scan local VMs hosted on VMWare Workstation in order run credentialed scans to discover vulnerabilities, remediate some of the vulnerabilities, then perform a rescan to verify remediation. You can use this lab for your resume to gain experience when applying to vulnerability management roles!

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>VMWare Workstation</b>
- <b>Nessus Essentials</b>
- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)
